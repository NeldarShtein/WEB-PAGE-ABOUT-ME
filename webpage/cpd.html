						<td>First of all, my new job helped me to feel more independent. After moving to the UK, I started to earn money here, which was enough to make me almost completely independent of my parents. Considering the pandemic situation and other circumstances, it was not easy to deal with all the problems. I had to change jobs more than once, but it was definitely worth it. It helped me to develop persistence and fortitude in myself. Besides, I also get work experience and in the future I will be able to use some knowledge, getting from this job, for instance, I learned patience and how to properly communicate with the boss.</td>
						<td>The type of the job will change depending on further study schedule,  personal interests, salary and other circumstances</td>

I gained support and information about the education system, University buildings, and the cityâ€™s infrastructure. I found some new close friends that helped me to socialize and improve my wellbeing. Furthermore, I also helped to run the Russian Speaking online classes and share my language knowledge. In the future, I am looking forward to being involved in Society activities.</td>
